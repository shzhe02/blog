Content = """Hi! I'm Harvey Lim. Here's a quick introduction of me:
- I am a **3rd-year university student studying at Aalto University**.
- My major is **Digital Systems and Design**, and I am minoring in **Computer Science**.
- I enjoy prototyping and tinkering with 3D printers.

This website is a small blog of sorts, with posts revolving around my interests. I hope you enjoy reading what I have created!

For now, there are 3 sections:
- [Bundles](/bundles)
    - Bundles are essentially information packets which I create to share the experience I have with a particular hobby or interest of mine.
- [Logbooks](/logbooks)
    - Logbooks are where I write log entries detailing a process I am currently undertaking.
- [About](/about)
    - This section includes more information about me and this site.
