## Finding Suitable Metrics

To reiterate, the goal of this benchmarking is to **maximize the amount of things done**. If I were to turn it into a formula, it would look something like this:
$$
\text{Tasks Completed} = \text{Hours spent doing tasks} \times \text{Tasks Completed per Hour}
$$
Now, we can clearly see two metrics that we can use for the self-benchmarking process. However, I did impose some ground rules on the benchmarking process in the last post, which once again, are the following:
- I can only start benchmarking after completing my morning routines.
- I can benchmark myself for 10 hours a day at most.
- The benchmark can be stopped as long as it has taken place for at least 5 continuous hours.
- Only one benchmark session can take place per day.

So, I have decided to split up the equation into 3 scoring systems:
$$
\text{Overall Score} = \text{Score A} \times \text{Score B}
$$
$$
\text{Score A} = \frac{\text{Hours spent doing tasks}}{\text{Total benchmarking session time}}
$$
$$
\text{Score B} = \text{Tasks Completed per Hour}
$$
For now, I will be focusing on improving Score A, as Score B is much more difficult to accurately score as tasks can vary greatly in difficulty, and it is also dependent on a lot of other factors, such as my ability to focus/concentrate. Score A is also a lot easier to improve, as it is possible for me to identify what is wasting my time and form plans to decrease wasted time (which I will refer to as "dead time" from here onward).
