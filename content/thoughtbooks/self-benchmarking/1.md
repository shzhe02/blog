## Origin

**TL;DR: Project TTMS is only part of the solution to self-organization.**

While I was pondering about Project TTMS, I realized that the whole point of an organizational system is to make the process of planning and organizing tasks as seamless as possible, such that I can maximize the amount of effective time (time spent **actually executing** the tasks).

However, no matter how seamless my self-organizational system is, it doesn't matter if I cannot actually execute my tasks efficiently. 

So, how do I maximize my execution efficiency?

My first thought was simply tackling this as if I were an algorithm (the software kind). To optimize an algorithm, one usually does the following steps:
1. Design the algorithm
2. Test the algorithm
3. Benchmark the algorithm
4. Optimize the algorithm
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the desired outcome is achieved

Now, let's adapt the steps above if we think about the algorithm being me executing tasks.
1. Make me exist (DONE, you're reading something I wrote, after all.)
2. Test myself (DONE, because I'm capable of doing tasks.)
3. Benchmark myself
4. Optimize how I complete tasks
5. Repeat 3-4 until the desired outcome is achieved

To summarize, the entire point of this thoughtbook is going to be about what I do to perform steps 3 and 4.
