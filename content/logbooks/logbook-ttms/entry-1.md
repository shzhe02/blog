## Introduction

I believe that time management systems along with task management systems are absolutely essential for self-organization in the modern world. Despite that, my current systems are sorely lacking for the life I currently lead as well as the life I want to lead. I have tried better systems before, but I inevitably end up reverting to using a barely-functional system after a few months.

> To quickly clarify on what I mean by task and time management systems:
> 
> Task management systems are for keeping track of which tasks still need to be done (e.g. to-do list, kanban board), while time management systems are for planning how time should be spent (e.g. calendar, timetable).
> 
> Of course, the two categories of systems are not actually as discrete as I am making them out to be, but I will discuss that later.

To get an idea of what my current "barely-functional system" is, it simply consists of two parts:
- A digital calendar for keeping track of important events or appointments.
- Scrap pieces of paper, used as to-do lists when there is lots of work to be done (for example, if three assignments are due within the next 24 hours).

It may work for now, but it certainly isn't going to last for much longer, especially considering that I am approaching the end of my bachelor's degree.
