To recap, the requirements I set for this systems are the following:
1. Be digital.
2. Support multiple devices and syncing.
3. Allow the user to remain in full control of their data.
4. Be easy to set up.

In order to tackle requirements 2 and 3, requirement 1 will have to be fulfilled. In other words, the system will have to be bundled into an app. There is no way to set up a 

For the app to have multi-device support (first part of requirement 2), I *could* create 3-4 different native implementations for each type of device, but that would be far too much work. Instead, using a cross-platform framework of some kind would be more ideal. After some research, my options are the following:
- Create a web app using a JavaScript framework (React, Vue) then turn it into mobile app using Electron or Capacitor.
- Use a cross-platform framework like Flutter or React Native.

Since I've previously built applications with Flutter before, I will be using it as my framework of choice. However, my previous applications were quite simple in comparison with what I'm trying to achieve with this project, therefore I will be making several sub-projects to get the hang of it in the process.
