## Goals

### Hardware
- On-off switch (Like the Corne)
	- There should be a switch to disconnect the battery on the hardware level.
- Usage of a XIAO nRF52840
	- It should utilize Seeed Studio's XIAO nRF52840 as the controller.
	- (This was a cost-cutting measure; the nice!nano, a commonly used bluetooth microcontroller, costs about 26â‚¬ a piece excl. shipping, while this board costs only $10.)

### Software
- ZMK
	- It should use ZMK as its firmware.

### Design
- Large and flexible battery capacity 
	- The PCB should allow for mounting of large and small batteries.
	- There should be at least two battery mounting options.
	- The battery mounting spots should be able to accommodate up to 1000mAh LiPo batteries.
- 3D-printed case
	- It should be possible to mount the board in a 3D-printed case which does not tilt or raise the PCB significantly.
- Melted PCB traces
	- The traces should be melted using the [Round Tracks](https://github.com/mitxela/kicad-round-tracks) plugin. (Because it's cool!)
- Aggressive column stagger (Like the Ferris Sweep)
	- The column for the pinky finger should be aggressively staggered.
