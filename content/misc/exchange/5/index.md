This is going to be a really long, detailed report about my exchange semester at NUS. Some parts are just about administrative processes and paperwork, which may be boring, so feel free to skip and read as needed. 

I'm simply going into a lot of detail as I myself wished I had known everything about what to expect before my exchange. Also, get ready to remember a whole lot of abbreviations.
# Background

Hi! I'm a 3rd-year bachelor student at Aalto University, taking the Digital Systems and Design major. Formally, my degree is

> Aalto Bachelor in Science and Technology and M.Sc. (Tech.) - Digital Systems and Design

Between the 10th of January to the 13th of May (Semester 2/Terms IV-V) in 2024, I was on exchange at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

**Disclaimer:** Before I talk about my experience, I would like to note that I'm originally from Malaysia (has similarities in culture/life), which means I may completely miss some things that other exchangers may find weird/interesting as I'm used to them. (For example, Singlish is something I'm fairly used to hearing/using)

# Pre-Exchange

## Applying, Part 1: Aalto's side

To apply for an exchange semester at NUS, I had to first pick out the courses I wanted to take. I used [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com/) to help me find courses, and I selected 6. The requirements that were set were:
- At least 70% of the courses must be from the College of Design and Engineering (which included electrical engineering courses, mechanical engineering courses, etc).
- The courses needed to be in a list of courses available to exchange (aka non-graduating) students.
- I cannot select a course whose content largely overlaps with a course I have already completed at Aalto.
- The first digit of the numerical part of the course code should be between 1-4 (denotes bachelor-level courses). That is, I could apply to attend CS1010 or CS2100, but not CS5218.

Luckily, most of the courses available were courses I was allowed to take, so my process involved first finding the course I want on NUSMods, then using Ctrl + F in the list to figure out if I'm allowed to take it.

Additionally, it seemed like almost all courses at NUS courses have the following types of sessions:
- In-person lecture, which may or may not have attendance taken. Almost all courses have lectures.
- Tutorials, which involve walking through the solutions for exercises. Tutorial sessions are usually not graded, but attendance may be taken. Only some courses have tutorials.
- Labs, which involve doing exercises with minimal assistance. Lab sessions are graded, and attendance will usually be taken. Only some courses have labs.

Tutorials and labs are somewhat like what we in Finland consider "exercise sessions."

Anyway, I used NUSMods to verify that the courses I picked had minimal overlapping sessions as well.

A small interesting fact: some courses at NUS have lectures that end at 9 PM, which was pretty crazy to me.

After submitting my application, I successfully got "nominated" (which basically means I've been approved on Aalto's end) despite the difficult odds for NUS applications (44 applications, 8 + 8 accepted).

**Fun fact:** NUSMods was actually a student-started project! And thank goodness for it, as all other means of figuring out course schedules are a nightmare to work through.

## Applying, Part 2: NUS's side

During late August, I received an email from my exchange coordinator about the next steps. I had almost the whole of September to submit an exchange application on NUS's side via a web portal, which included my personal details as well my course selection. However, this time round, I was to submit 8 courses. I head this was due to the fact that getting courses at NUS is a lot more difficult than at Aalto. Additionally, I had to submit my Aalto course transcript for some of the courses to prove that I met their prerequisites.

Also, when I was submitting my transcript, it turned out that NUS requires a transcript that is stamped with the seal of my home university. I asked if digitally-signed PDFs were acceptable, but I guess they don't really accept such forms of verification. Turns out I could get a printed copy of my transcript with Aalto's stamp from IT services, which I eventually did and then scanned for uploading.

After submitting that application and waiting until early November, I received my course selection results. Of my original 8 selected courses, I only received spots in 3, among which 2 had conflicting timetables. So, I effectively only had 2 courses confirmed, when the minimum I need to be accepted as an exchanger at NUS is 3 (this is an NUS requirement, not an Aalto one).

Luckily, there's a second round of course selections. This time, I applied for 4 more courses, and I received 2 of those, leaving me with a grand total of 4 courses, allowing me to safely meet the 3-course requirement.

Upon successfully applying on NUS's side, I had to submit a photo of myself which met their requirements. I did this with my phone, then cropped the image in an image editing software to Singaporean passport's photo size and resolution standards.

**Interesting note:** All approval procedures and customer helplines in Singapore were really responsive. If I email something in the middle of the week, I usually get a response within 12-48 hours, usually closer to 12 hours.
## Applying - Part 3: "Registration Part 1"

This involved giving my personal details and my emergency contacts, among other things. Upon completing the form, I was given an NUS student ID, and I had to register for an NUS account, which was what I would use during the semester to access NUS online services. The ones of note are:
- Canvas: This is effectively the NUS equivalent of MyCourses at Aalto. This is where you can check assignment grades and access course material.
- EduRec: This is effectively the NUS equivalent of Sisu at Aalto. This is where you can check details on your courses and see your grades. One thing that differs from Sisu is that some student payments are also done in EduRec. I would like to note that the interface is really slow and also really annoying to navigate (a lot of exchangers struggled with finding certain important pages).
- Email: This is a standard o365 instance, but it runs on a Microsoft Exchange server. Along with some odd settings they have behind the scenes, I couldn't directly link Thunderbird (my preferred email client) to it, meaning I had to use the Owl for Exchange extension (paid, but has free trial) for Thunderbird to access my NUS email. I eventually just gave up after the free trial of Owl ended and just used Outlook, though.
- uNiVus App: This is some kind of all-in-one student app. I can access Canvas, NUSMods, among other useful student-related apps through this app. Additionally, it functions like a digital student card.

Interestingly, during this process, I was told to use my Aalto email address as my "personal" email. In hindsight, this was a great decision, as my NUS email was absolutely bombarded with tons of different NUS newsletters and announcements over the course of my exchange.

Also, by this point, it is worth noting that the NUS exchangers' WhatsApp group chat should be super active by this point.

## Applying - Part 4: Accommodation

Getting my NUS account also allowed me to start applying for housing. However, my dumb, procrastinating self spent so long researching accommodations and fearing actually applying that I only realized that I had yet to apply for accommodation when the second on-campus housing application period rolled around.

Here's what the housing situation is like around NUS. You generally have the following choices.
- On-campus
	- Halls
	- Houses
	- Residences
	- Residential Colleges
- Off-campus
	- Apartment rentals (\$\$\$)
	- Dormitories of nearby schools (\$\$)

I've only heard a bit about off-campus housing from other exchange students in the exchange chats, so I won't be going into detail about those here. I also have zero idea about residential colleges, as I only found out about them well into my exchange semester.

As for what the difference is between halls, houses, and residences:

### Halls

Halls, to my understanding, are accommodations with super active student groups and societies. There are tons of activities available for people living in halls to participate in. It's an extrovert's dream, I guess. Staying at a hall requires you to also pay for a meal plan up front, for which you'll get meal credits that you can redeem at canteens.

There are 6 halls at NUS, namely:
- Kent Ridge Hall
- Eusoff Hall
- King Edward VII Hall
- Raffles Hall
- Sheares Hall
- Temasek Hall

Hall rooms usually do not have air conditioning ("aircon" and "AC" will be the terms I'll be using to refer to this from now on).

### Residences

Residences, to my understanding, are accommodations that are pretty much like rental apartments. There isn't a lot of student activity going on, and it's just a place for you to stay.

There are two residences at NUS, namely:
- Prince George's Park Residences (PGPR)
- UTown Residences (UTR)

UTR is usually the go-to for exchange students.

Residence rooms have both aircon and non-aircon options, with aircon rooms being more expensive.

### Houses

Houses are somewhere in between halls and residences. There are a fair amount of student activities present, just not as much as halls. Some students living in houses are also quite reserved.

There are three houses at NUS, namely:
- LightHouse
- Pioneer House (formerly PGP House)
- Helix House

All houses are located in the area right next to PGPR, which is called Prince George's Park (PGP).

Some houses only have aircon rooms, while others have a mix of aircon and non-aircon rooms.

### Housing Application, resumed

Anyway, using NUS's student accommodation system called UHMS, I was able to start applying for housing. I picked the following options, in that order:
- UTR, AC
- UTR, non-AC
- PGPR, non-AC

I got allocated to... none of them.

However~ there was a little box I ticked during my application, specifying that I do not mind being assigned to some other room if I got rejected by all my options. This led me to stay in Pioneer House! But, it's a non-aircon room... (non-aircon tales coming later)

The rent for staying at Pioneer House (will be abbreviated to PH from now on) was 135 SGD/week, which had to be paid upfront. My stay was from 11th of January to 12th of May, totaling 17 weeks and 3 days, hence it cost 2,312 SGD (1,584 Euros as of 11th July). However, that was only for the stay starting on the 14th of January. To stay from the 11th to the 14th, I had to apply for early check-in, costing 58.29 SGD (39.94 Euros as of 11th July).

(I'm only realizing now that 2,312 > 17 x 135 and I have no idea where the extra cost came from either. Oh well...)

## Applying, Part 5: Student's Pass Application

Not to be confused with a student card, a Student's Pass (aka STP) is essentially a student visa. As I had stayed in Singapore for more than 30 days, a visa was required. This required me to fill in a form for the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), which was called eForm16. It's a pretty generic immigration form. One thing to note here is that the form was directly linked to the previous application I made for NUS, so I had to keep track of my previous application ID.

Upon approval, I don't actually get my STP immediately. STP is only actually activated after the offsite enrollment (yes, there are going to be more application-related steps). Instead, I get something called an In-Principle Approval (IPA). The IPA has two purposes:
- It is needed at the offsite enrollment, in printed form.
- It acts as a temporary visa to enter Singapore if your passport doesn't allow for visa-free entry.

**Tip:** If you plan to use Singpass (Singapore's equivalent of our Finnish banks' "strong identification") you should also write down/store the Foreign Identification Number (FIN) written in the IPA. It's not the same FIN in your passport.
