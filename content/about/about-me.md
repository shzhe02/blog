# TL;DR

Hello there, my name is Harvey Lim (21M, as of August 2023).

I am a Malaysian-born Chinese person who has gone through education in Finland. However, I only speak native-level English along with conversational-level Chinese.

Currently, I am a 3rd-year bachelors student at Aalto University, majoring in Digital Systems and Design and minoring in Computer Science.

There are actually several variations of my name:
- Harvey Lim Shuang Zhe
	- This is my original full name.
- Harvey Shuang Zhe Lim
	- In western countries, I have to put my surname (Lim) at the end of my name, causing it to be reorganized a bit.
- 林双喆 (lín shuāng zhé)
	- My Chinese name, which I use rarely.
- 双喆 (shuāng zhé)
	- The nickname version of my Chinese name.

In a nutshell, calling me "Harvey" will do just fine :)
