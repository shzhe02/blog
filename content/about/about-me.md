# TL;DR

Hello there, my name is Harvey Lim (21M, as of August 2023).

I am a Malaysian-born Chinese person who has gone through education in Finland. However, I only speak native-level English along with conversational-level Chinese.

Currently, I am a 3rd-year bachelors student at Aalto University, majoring in Digital Systems and Design and minoring in Computer Science.
