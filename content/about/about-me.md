Hello there, my name is Harvey Lim Shuang Zhe, but there are several variations of my name:
- Harvey Shuang Zhe Lim
	- In western countries, I have to put my surname (Lim) at the end of my name, causing it to be reorganized a bit.
- Harvey Lim
	- This is the first-name-then-surname variation of the name, which is my go-to for most casual situations.
- 林双喆 (lín shuāng zhé)
	- My Chinese name, which I use rarely.
- 双喆 (shuāng zhé)
	- The nickname version of my Chinese name.

In a nutshell, calling my "Harvey" will do just fine :)

I am a Malaysian-born Chinese person who has gone through education in Finland. However, I only speak native-level English along with conversational-level Chinese.

Currently, I am a 3rd-year bachelors student at Aalto University, majoring in Digital Systems and Design and minoring in Computer Science.

My interests primarily revolve around 2 concepts:
- Expanding my skillset
	- I am aiming for a jack-of-all-trades skillset, as I enjoy being able to tackle a large spectrum of challenges and tasks while simultaneously improving my problem-solving skills. (I would like to note that I seek skills within certain domains of interest. Not every skill from every field interests me.)
- Improving efficiency
	- I am particularly interested in reducing the energy consumption of technology.
