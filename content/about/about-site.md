The main purpose of this site to allow me to create and share content easily.

After trying numerous other website-creation tools, I eventually settled on using the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io) along with the [PaperModX theme](https://reorx.github.io/hugo-PaperModX/) which I [forked](https://github.com/shzhe02/PaperModX-nordish) to apply the [Nord color scheme](https://www.nordtheme.com/).

All the content pages are written in the Markdown format, which then allows me to use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as my text editor of choice, which works fantastic! I only needed to pull some easy gitignore magic to exclude the Obsidian-related files from the content of the website.

If you want to know more about my previous attempts at creating this site and why I discarded them, have a look [here](/thoughtbooks/site-history)!
