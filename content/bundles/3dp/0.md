## Introduction

For most people getting started with 3D printing, it usually seems like a black box; you give it a 3D model of something you want, and it spits out a real, tangible object. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing inherently wrong with viewing 3D printing this way. However, that's like buying a racing bike just to use it in 1st gear all the time; gaining a little more understanding about how the machine (or bicycle, if we are to continue the analogy) works goes a long way for getting what you want done faster and better.

This bundle is designed in modules: each module contains information about one particular stage of the 3D printing process with the goal of optimizing it. Each module gets progressively more obscure with diminishing returns, but you may choose to stop whenever you feel like your prints are good enough.

**This bundle will be focusing on FDM/FFF (Fused Deposition Modelling/Fused Filament Fabrication) 3D printing. In human terms, the type of 3D printing where plastic filament is involved.**

## What is the 3D printing process?

It is the process to get from an idea of a component to a printed 3D model.

In this bundle, the 3D printing process I will be referring to is the following:
1. Designing the 3D model
2. Slicing the 3D model
3. Printing the model
