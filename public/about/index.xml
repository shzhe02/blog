      <description>The main purposes of this site are:
to allow me to create and share content easily. to be quick and easy to use for a reader. After trying numerous other website-creation tools, I eventually settled on using the Hugo static site generator along with the PaperModX theme which I forked to apply the Nord color scheme.
All the content pages are written in the Markdown format, which then allows me to use Obsidian as my text editor of choice, which works fantastic!</description>
