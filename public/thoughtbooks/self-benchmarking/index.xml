      <description>The Three Types of Task Control After pondering about the topic for a long time, I took some inspiration from a business-related course I previously attended. Push and pull systems in particular stood out to me because I felt like push and pull systems could be abstraction terms used to describe certain task management systems.

<p>After pondering about the topic for a long time, I took some inspiration from a business-related course I previously attended. <strong>Push and pull systems</strong> in particular stood out to me because I felt like push and pull systems could be abstraction terms used to describe certain task management systems.</p>
<hr>
<p>(REWRITE IN PROGRESS)</p>
<p>In modern society, we&rsquo;re largely deadline-driven, as it is the easiest method for something to get done. If the consequences of not meeting the deadline are severe enough, there is a much lesser need for self-discipline or motivation.</p>
<p>One thing I find really relevant to the effectiveness of deadlines is Parkinson&rsquo;s Law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Work expands to fill the time allocated to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rings true for basically all my deadline-based tasks I need to complete, as I have a horrible tendency to only get started only hours or days before a deadline.</p>
<p>But what about tasks that don&rsquo;t have deadlines? Do I simply set deadlines for myself?</p>
<h2 id="deadlines">Deadlines</h2>
<p>Before I venture further, I want to explain how deadlines work for me. I&rsquo;m very honest towards myself, which means that self-rewarding or self-punishing rarely works. Rewarding/punishing only works for me if the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is external (e.g. the reward itself is out of my control).</li>
<li>I deem that the consequence/reward is worth the difficulty of the task.</li>
</ul>
<p>For some concrete examples, the following works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting enough points in an assignment such as to not fail a course.
<ul>
<li>The punishment here is having to study things again to prepare for a retake, or having to do the course all over again. (Consequence is worth the task difficulty: it&rsquo;s easier to complete the course properly than study everything again for the retake.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>while the following does not work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put in the extra work to complete a course with 100% of the points to get a free rubber ducky.
<ul>
<li>Is the rubber ducky worth all the extra time? If I really wanted one, I would simply pay for one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From the examples above, I hope you can tell why the second condition exists. However, that leaves the first condition. I hinted at its reason in the second example above, which is that <strong>if there is an alternate easier path to the reward, I would take that instead.</strong> For example, if my goal is to have an ice cream, why would I do this:</p>
<pre class="mermaid">flowchart LR
	1("Do 30 jumping jacks")
	2("Go to the grocery store")
	3("Get an ice cream")
	1 --> 2
	2 --> 3
</pre>
<p>when I can do this?</p>
<pre class="mermaid">flowchart LR
	1("Go to the grocery store")
	2("Get an ice cream")
	1 --> 2
</pre>
<p>The path to the reward or away from the consequence must be a reasonably efficient route.</p>
<p>In summary, to me, a deadline is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A point in time when a particular task is due.</li>
<li>If not completed within the allocated time span, consequences <strong>will</strong> follow.</li>
<li>The consequences must matter to me, and they must be real and external.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why wasn&rsquo;t rewarding in that summary? It&rsquo;s because deadlines are fundamentally consequence-based, as having a reward at the end would simply mean that the consequence is being deprived of the reward.</p>
<h3 id="self-set-deadlines">Self-set deadlines</h3>
<p>From the previous section, you can probably already tell why self-set deadlines are very difficult for me. If I want to set an artificial consequence or reward for the completion of a task, the consequence/reward would already be in my control, and adding a task to the process only makes the route to the reward less efficient.</p>
<h2 id="no-deadlines">No deadlines?</h2>
<p>At first glance, this approach might seem super stupid. If I don&rsquo;t set a deadline, wouldn&rsquo;t Parkinson&rsquo;s Law effectively cause me to abandon my tasks indefinitely? The answer is yes and no. Yes, in the sense that I have abandoned projects before due to having no deadlines, but also no in the sense that some projects I have executed in the past have been completed at full speed.</p>

      <description>Finding Suitable Metrics To reiterate, the goal of this benchmarking is to maximize the amount of things done.
I think there are two main factors that affect this metric:
How much time is actually spent doing tasks How effectively time is spent doing tasks Both factors are not very straightforward to improve, as they tend to get better with practice. However, some measures for anti-procrastination and anti-distraction may help to speed up the progress for the first factor.</description>

      <description>Origin TL;DR: Project TTMS is only part of the solution to self-organization.
While I was pondering about Project TTMS, I realized that the whole point of an organizational system is to make the process of planning and organizing tasks as seamless as possible, such that I can maximize the amount of effective time (time spent actually doing the tasks). No matter how seamless my self-organizational system is, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if I cannot actually execute my tasks efficiently.</description>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Project TTMS is only part of the solution to self-organization.</strong></p>
<p>While I was pondering about Project TTMS, I realized that the whole point of an organizational system is to make the process of planning and organizing tasks as seamless as possible, such that I can maximize the amount of effective time (time spent <strong>actually doing</strong> the tasks). No matter how seamless my self-organizational system is, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I cannot actually execute my tasks efficiently.</p>
<p>In essence, the goal for both self-benchmarking and Project TTMS is to <strong>get as many things done as possible</strong>.</p>
<p>So, how do I get more things done?</p>
<h2 id="why-benchmark">Why Benchmark?</h2>
<p>My first thought was simply tackling this as if I were an algorithm (the software kind). To optimize an algorithm, one usually does the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design the algorithm</li>
<li>Test the algorithm</li>
<li>Benchmark the algorithm</li>
<li>Optimize the algorithm</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2-4 until the desired outcome is achieved</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s adapt the steps above if we think about the algorithm being me executing tasks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make me exist (DONE, you&rsquo;re reading something I wrote, after all.)</li>
<li>Test myself (DONE, because I&rsquo;m capable of doing tasks.)</li>
<li>Benchmark myself</li>
<li>Optimize how I complete tasks</li>
<li>Repeat 3-4 until the desired outcome is achieved</li>
</ol>
<p>To summarize, the entire point of this thoughtbook is going to be about what I do to perform steps 3 and 4, but since benchmarking will take the bulk of the time, most of the posts will be focused on that.</p>
<h3 id="setting-limits">Setting Limits</h3>
<p>When it comes to benchmarking, I also need to set some ground rules/limits. I could hypothetically aim for the following:</p>
<pre class="mermaid">flowchart LR
	1("Wake up")
	2("Do tasks")
	3("Sleep")
	1 --> 2
	2 --> 3
	3 --> 1
</pre>
<p>but I can already tell that is neither realistic (I&rsquo;m not going to be benchmarking myself forever&hellip;) nor is it sustainable, as it leaves me super prone to burnout.</p>
<p>I eventually settled on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can only start benchmarking after completing my morning routines.</li>
<li>I can benchmark myself for 10 hours a day at most.</li>
<li>The benchmark can be stopped as long as it has taken place for at least 5 continuous hours.</li>
<li>Only one benchmark session can take place per day.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-prerequisites-of-benchmarking">The Prerequisites of Benchmarking</h2>
<p>In my opinion, any benchmark needs to have two prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>It needs to involve a metric that&rsquo;s measurable.</li>
<li>It needs to be repeatable.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="measurability">Measurability</h3>
<p>The reason why a benchmark is useful for optimization (in general) is because it lets us figure out if a change positively impacted whatever we are optimizing.</p>
<h3 id="repeatability">Repeatability</h3>
<p>Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you think about it), humans aren&rsquo;t exactly computers. We are much more unpredictable than computers, and there&rsquo;s even a whole field called psychology for attempting to predict our unpredictable nature.</p>
<p>If we want to benchmark something, it&rsquo;s very important that the benchmark is <strong>repeatable</strong>. If the results are all over the place, their significance is essentially useless.</p>
